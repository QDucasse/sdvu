# Simple DiVine processing Unit

This project consists of a **minimal CPU** called (SDVU) that is able to process binaries generated by the **compiler** ([SDVC](https://github.com/QDucasse/sdvc)). Its behavior is reproduced by a **simulator** ([SDVS](https://github.com/QDucasse/sdvs)) written in Python. All the binaries are generated from compiling a simplification of the DiVinE description language into an **single-static-assignment form** (Simple DiVinE or SDVE). The **BEEM benchmark** used to characterize DVE models is translated to SDVE to provide samples to test the whole ecosystem ([SDVE BEEM](https://github.com/QDucasse/sdve-beem-benchmark)).
